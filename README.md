AI-Based Predictive Personnel Stress and Welfare Monitoring System for Uniformed Forces 

# Project Overview 
The proposed MANRAKSHA system is an AI-powered personnel welfare platform that analyzes organizational and voluntarily provided wellness data to identify early indicators of stress and burnout.
## Key components:
HR, duty, workload and deployment data analysis.
Secure mobile-based wellness self-assessment.
Optional biometric/wearable data where authorized.
AI-based stress, burnout and fatigue detection.
Predictive risk scoring and stress trajectory analysis.
Explainable welfare alerts for authorized officers.
Personalized recommendations for counselling, rest and workload balancing.
Privacy-preserving architecture with encryption, anonymization and RBAC.
## Core principle: 
Predict the need for support, not the fitness of the individual.

# Key Features 
*Stress Trajectory:* Tracks changing risk instead of relying on one-time assessments.
*Predictive Analytics:* Identifies rising risk before it becomes critical.
*Voluntary Wellness App:* Enables confidential self-assessment.
*Optional Biometrics:* Supports authorized physiological/wearable data.
*Explainable AI:* Shows factors influencing risk predictions.
*Personalized Interventions:* Recommends appropriate welfare actions.
*Automated Alerts:* Provides timely notifications to authorized personnel.
*Privacy-by-Design:* Protects sensitive personnel information.
*Human-in-the-Loop:* AI supports welfare officers rather than replacing human judgment.

# System Strengths

## Feasibility
Uses existing AI/ML and predictive analytics technologies.
Can integrate with existing HRMS and personnel management systems.
Requires minimal additional hardware for initial deployment.
Supports secure cloud or on-premise implementation.
Mobile wellness application enables convenient self-reporting.
Modular architecture allows phased implementation and testing.
Can be scaled from a pilot unit to force-wide deployment.
Existing cybersecurity technologies can support encryption and access control.
## Viability
Enables early and preventive welfare intervention.
Reduces dependence on manual monitoring.
Supports evidence-based workload and personnel management.
Improves visibility of workforce-level welfare trends.
Continuous monitoring enables identification of changing risk patterns.
Privacy safeguards can improve personnel trust and participation.
Feedback mechanisms allow continuous improvement of the system.

## Business / Market Potential
Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs)
Indian Armed Forces
State Police Organizations
Disaster Response & Emergency Services
Government departments with high-stress workforces
Corporate employee wellness platforms
International security and workforce-welfare organizations
## Impact
Risk Identification at Early Stages – Picks up signs of stress and burnout before they reach critical levels.
Well-being – Facilitates counseling and welfare measures.
Fatigue Reduction – Assists in recognizing overwork and inadequate recuperation periods.
Readiness Enhancement – Promotes healthier and sturdier staff.
Effective Planning of Welfare Services – Based on factual information about the organization.
Prevention of Stress-Induced Cases – Motivates preventive action.
